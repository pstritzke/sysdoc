        <p>Exim come with default configuration, we will change
        /etc/exim/aliases;</p>

        <p>Add exim to hosts.allow</p>

        <pre>
        #
        # /etc/hosts.allow
        #

        # <service>: <ip>
        exim: 127.0.0.1

        # End of file
        </pre>

        <p>Lets create alias for user so system email gets delivered
        to user mail dir;</p>


        <pre>
        # Default aliases file, installed by Exim. This file contains no real aliases.
        # You should edit it to taste.

        # The following alias is required by the mail RFCs 2821 and 2822.
        # Set it to the address of a HUMAN who deals with this system's mail problems.

        postmaster: user@localhost

        # It is also common to set the following alias so that if anybody replies to a
        # bounce message from this host, the reply goes to the postmaster.

        mailer-daemon: postmaster

        # You should also set up an alias for messages to root, because it is not
        # usually a good idea to deliver mail as root.

        root: postmaster

        # It is a good idea to redirect any messages sent to system accounts so tha
        # they don't just get ignored. Here are some common examples:

        bin: root
        daemon: root
        ftp: root
        nobody: root
        operator: root
        uucp: root

        # You should check your /etc/passwd for any others.

        # Other commonly enountered aliases are:
        #
        # abuse:       the person dealing with network and mail abuse
        # hostmaster:  the person dealing with DNS problems
        # webmaster:   the person dealing with your web site
