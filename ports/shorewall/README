5.0.2.1

1)  When processing the 'dump' command, the CLI now uses 'netstat' to
    print socket information when the 'ss' utility is not installed.

2)  Several defects in the installers/uninstallers have been corrected
    (Matt Darfeuille).

5.0.2

1)  This release includes defect repair up through Shoreall 5.0.1.1.

2)  The MSSQL macro now allows UDP port 1434 (Tuomo Soini).

3)  A number of issues with param file processing on Cygwin have been
    corrected. The most serious of these issues was introduction of
    syntax errors into the generated firewall script.

4)  More version numbers have been removed from configuration files
    and Macros (Tuomo Soini).

5)  The check for use of a circular kernel log buffer (as opposed to a
    log file) has been improved.

6)  Previously, HOST=default was accepted by configure[.pl], but the
    generated shorewallrc file was unusable. Now, HOST=default is
    equivalent to HOST=linux.

7)  Previously, if a circular log buffer was being used, the output of
    various commands still displayed '/var/log/messages' as the log
    file. Now, it is displayed as 'logread'.

8)  The 'remote-*' commands now return correct exit status.

9)  Previously, if LOCKFILE specified a file in a directory other than
    $VARDIR, and that directory did not exist, it was not created
    automatically.

10) Previously, optional interfaces were not enabled during 'start' and
    'restart' unless there was at least one entry in the 'providers'
    file.  This resulted in these interfaces not appearing in the
    output of 'shorewall[6] status -i'.

1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  The providers file now supports a 'persistent' option. When
    specified, this option removes the need to configure host routes to
    systems used as the 'checkip' in LSM.

    As part of this change, two other configuration files have changed:

    a) The 'rtrules' file now allows the rule priority to be followed
       by an exclaimation mark ("!").

    b) An OPTION column has been added to the 'routes' file. The only
       option currently supported is 'persistent'.

    The option affects the routing configuration when the provider is
    disabled:

    - The provider's routing table still exists and contains the
      provider's default route.

    - Unless 'noautosrc' is specified, connections originating from the
      interfaces IP address(es) are routed via the provider's default
      gateway.

    - Routing rules for the provider that specify '!' after the
      priority are left in place.

    - 'persistent' routes for the provider are left in place, allowing
      communication with local networks that are still accessible.

2)  It is now possible to replace any function in the CLI libraries
    except for get_config(). This is accomplished by placing the
    replacement function(s) in a shell library named 'lib.cli-user' in
    a directory on the CONFIG_PATH. This allows for customization of
    commands as well as working around distribution-specific issues.

3)  Support for OpenWRT versions BB and later has been added. Included
    in this support are:

    - The log display commands (show log, logwatch, etc.) no longer
      depend on the 'tac' utility (although it will be used if it is
      installed).

    - Shorewall-core's 'configure' script detects OpenWRT and accepts
      HOST=openwrt as an argument.
      
    - Shorewall-core, Shorewall-lite and Shoreawll6-lite installers
      support openwrt. Additionally, those installers no longer depend
      on the 'install' utility.

    - Shorewall[6]-lite will use OpenWRT's 'lock' utility to create the
      LOCKFILE.

    A special thanks to Matt Darfeuille for his help in making this
    support possible.

4)  Configuration files and extension scripts now have uniform
    introductory comments (Tuomo Soini).

                  I V.  M I G R A T I O N   I S S U E S
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  If you are migrating from Shorewall 4.4.x or earlier, please see
    http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/4.5/shorewall-4.5.21/releasenotes.txt

2)  It is strongly recommended that you first upgrade your installation
    to a 4.6 release >= 5.6.12 prior to upgrading to Shorewall 5.0.

    Once you are on the Shorewall 4.6 release:

    - shorewall update -A

    If you also run Shorewall6:
    
    - shorewall6 update -A

    These steps are necessary because Shorewall 5.0:

    - Does not contain support for the 'tcrules' and 'tos' files --
      existing 'tcrules' and 'tos' files must be converted to an
      equivalent set of 'mangle' file entries.

    - Does not contain support for the 'blacklist' file -- it must
      be converted to an equivalent 'blrules' file.

    - Does not contain support for the 'notrack' file -- it must be
      converted to an equivalent 'conntrack' file.

    - Does not contain support for the 'routestopped' file -- it must
      be converted to an equivalent 'stoppedrules' file.

    Note that you can run the update command(s) after you upgrade to
    Shorewall 5 but your firewall will not work correctly until
    you do those update(s).

3)  The following configuration options have been eliminated:

    - EXPORTPARAMS
    - IPSECFILE
    - LEGACY_FASTSTART
    - LOGRATE *
    - LOGBURST *
    - WIDE_TC_MARKS *
    - HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS *
    - BLACKLISTNEWONLY *

    A fatal error results if those flagged with an asterisk ("*")
    appear in the .conf file -- run the 'shorewall[6] update' command
    to convert their settings to use supported options.

    A warning is issued if any of the rest appear in the .conf file.
    'shorewall[6] update' will drop them from the file.

4)  To make the command names more accurately reflect what they do,
    several changes have been included:

    a)  Beginning with this release, the 'restart' command now does a
    	true restart and is equivalent to a 'stop' followed by a
    	'start'.

    b)  The pre-5.0.0 'load' command has been renamed 'remote_start'.

    c)  The pre-5.0.0 'reload' command has been renamed 'remote_reload'.

    c)  The 'reload' command now performs the same function as the
    	pre-5.0.0 'restart' command.

    d)  A 'remote_restart' command has been added to Shorewall and
    	Shorewall6 to allow a remote 'restart' after updating the
    	remote firewall system's compiled script.

    For those that can't get used to the idea of using 'reload' in
    place of 'restart', a RESTART option has been added. The
    option defaults to 'reload' for compatibility with earlier
    releases. If set to 'restart', then the 'restart' command
    does a true restart (stop followed by start)

5)  While the WORKAROUNDS setting is still present in the
    shorewall[6].conf file:

    a)  It's default setting has been changed to No.
    
    b)  All workarounds for old distributions have been eliminated. See
    	the Migration Issues for additional information.

6)  Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.0, all macros and actions are assumed
    to be FORMAT-2.  FORMAT-1 macros and actions are no longer supported
    and will be silently processed as if they were FORMAT-2. For most
    macros and actions, this change will be of no concern, but may cause
    compilation errors in rare cases.

    To review, FORMAT-1 actions have the following columns:

       TARGET
       SOURCE
       DEST
       PROTO
       DEST PORT(S)
       SOURCE PORT(S)
       RATE
       USER/GROUP
       MARK

    FORMAT-1 macros have these columns:

       TARGET
       SOURCE
       DEST
       PROTO
       DEST PORT(S)
       SOURCE PORT(S)
       RATE
       USER/GROUP

    FORMAT-2 actions and macros, on the other hand, have:

       TARGET
       SOURCE
       DEST
       PROTO
       DEST PORT(S)
       SOURCE PORT(S)
       ORIGINAL DEST
       RATE
       USER/GROUP
       MARK
       CONNLIMIT
       TIME
       HEADERS (Only valid for IPv6)
       SWITCH
       HELPER

    To summarize, if your action or macro only uses the first 6
    columns (which most do), then it will process fine as
    FORMAT-2. Otherwise, it must be modified to place specifications in
    the proper columns.

7)  COMMENT, FORMAT and SECTION lines must now begin with a question
    mark ("?"). The 'update' command will change all bare COMMENT,
    FORMAT and SECTION lines to include the question mark.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Previously, if statistical load balancing was used in the providers
    file, the default route in the main table was not deleted during
    firewall start/restart. That route is now correctly deleted.

2)  Certain files in /etc/shorewall[6] previously had permissions 644.
    Those have been changed to 600 to match the other files in the
    directories.

3)  Previously, the CLI programs did not deal properly with the absense
    of the 'hostname' utility. Now, if that utility is not present, the
    programs look for 'uname' and if it is present, they use the 'uname
    -n' command. If neither 'hostname' nor 'uname' are installed, the
    programs display 'localhost' as the system name.                 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
               N E W   F E A T U R E S   I N   5 . 0 . 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  'second' and 'minute' are now allowed in the LOGLIMIT
    specification in place of 'sec' and 'min' respectively. This
    enhancement was present in Shorewall 4.6.13 but was not available
    in Shoreall 5.0.0.

2)  The LEGACY_RESTART option has been superseded by the RESTART
    option. RESTART may be set as follows:

      RESTART=reload

	Causes the 'restart' command to perform the same action as the
	'reload' command. This is the default if RESTART is not set.

      RESTART=restart

	Causes the 'restart' command to perform a true restart (stop
	followed by start).

    If LEGACY_RESTART is present in shorewall[6].conf and RESTART is
    not, then its setting will govern the behavior of 'restart'. The
    'update' command will convert the LEGACY_RESTART setting to the
    equivalent RESTART setting.

1)  This release includes defect repair up through Shorewall 4.6.13.1.

2)  The compiled script now uses the %e date format rather than %_d,
    for Busybox compatibilty. (Erich Titl)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  To make the command names more accurately reflect what they do,
    several changes have been included:

    a)  Beginning with this release, the 'restart' command now does a
    	true restart and is equivalent to a 'stop' followed by a
    	'start'.

    b)  The pre-5.0.0 'load' command has been renamed 'remote_start'.

    c)  The pre-5.0.0 'reload' command has been renamed 'remote_reload'.

    c)  The 'reload' command now performs the same function as the
    	pre-5.0.0 'restart' command.

    d)  A 'remote_restart' command has been added to Shorewall and
    	Shorewall6 to allow a remote 'restart' after updating the
    	remote firewall system's compiled script.

2)  For those that can't get used to the idea of using 'reload' in
    place of 'restart', a LEGACY_RESTART option has been added. The
    option defaults to No but if set to Yes, then the 'restart' command
    does what it has always done. 

3)  It is now possible to limit connections by destination address in
    the rules file by prefixing the CONNLIMIT setting with 'd:'.

4)  While the WORKAROUNDS setting is still present in the
    shorewall[6].conf files:

    a)  Its default setting has been changed to No.
    
    b)  All workarounds for old distributions have been eliminated. See
    	the Migration Issues for additional information.

5)  A number of configuration options have been eliminated:

    - EXPORTPARAMS
    - IPSECFILE
    - LEGACY_FASTSTART
    - LOGRATE *
    - LOGBURST *
    - WIDE_TC_MARKS *
    - HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS *
    - BLACKLISTNEWONLY *

    A fatal error results if those flagged with an asterisk ("*")
    appear in the .conf file -- run the 'shorewall[6] update' command
    to convert their settings to use supported options.

    A warning is issued if any of the rest appear in the .conf file.
    'shorewall[6] update' will drop them from the file.

7)  The -b, -D, -r, -s, -t and -n options have been removed from the
    'update' command. The command now behaves as if all of those
    options had been specified.

6)  Support has been removed for the 'blacklist', 'tcrules',
    'routestopped', 'notrack' and 'tos' files.

    The 'update' command will:

    - convert the 'tcrules' and 'tos' files to the equivalent 'mangle'
      file.

    - convert the 'blacklist' file into an equivalent 'blrules' file.

    - convert the routestopped' file into the equivalent 'stoppedrules'
      file.

    - convert a 'notrack' file to the equivalent 'conntrack' file.

7)  Beginning with this release, all macros and actions are assumed
    to be FORMAT-2. FORMAT-1 macros and actions are no longer supported
    and will be silently processed as if they were FORMAT-2. For most
    macros and actions, this change will be of no concern, but may cause
    compilation errors in rare cases.

8)  Beginning with this release, COMMENT, FORMAT and SECTION lines must
    begin with a question mark ("?"). The 'update' command makes these
    changes for you.

9)  As an alternative to INLINE_MATCHES=Yes, you may now specify inline
    matches (raw ip[6]tables text) after a double semicolon (';;').

    Example from the 'masq' file to split SNAT between two public
    addresses on eth1:

      #INTERFACE SOURCE ADDRESS
      eth1       -      1.2.3.1 ;; -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50
      eth1	 -	1.2.3.2

10) Options in shorewall[6].conf that accept a log level now also allow
    specification of a log tag.

    Example:

      TCP_FLAGS_LOG_LEVEL=info:,tcpflags

11) A PROBABILITY column has been added to the masq file. One usage
    scenario is to balance SNAT between two or more IP addresses on a
    WAN interface:

        #INTERFACE	SOURCE		ADDRESS
    	eth1		-		1.2.3.4 { probability=0.50 }
	eth2		-		1.2.3.5

12) Previously, when chain names were included in a 'reset' command,
    they were assumed to be filter table chains. Now, both a table name
    and a chain name can be given (e.g., mangle:PREROUTING). The
    specified table remains the default for the remainder of the
    command unless a following entry also includes a table name.

13) An action for Gluster FS (action.GlusterFS) has been added. See the
    action file for a description of the parameters.
