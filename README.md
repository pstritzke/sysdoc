### Some Notes ###

* This is not a "Handbook for CRUX" substitution.
* Don't cover Xorg installation or configuration.
* Not mean to be "full manual". 

### Configuration and Ports ###

* Less personalized ports is better.
* Less changes to configuration files is better.
* Less "packages" installed is better.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Try to use as much links to more information as possible.
* Keep html source minimal and readable.
* Contribute to this document :)

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Everyone
